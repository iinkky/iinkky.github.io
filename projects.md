## That Veterinary Guy

[thatveterinaryguy.co.uk](http://thatveterinaryguy.co.uk) is a website dedicated to medical news and veterinary education. 
The impetus for its creation was the apparent lack of veterinary websites focused on 
science rather than the education of pet owners.

## Programming Resourc.es

[programmingresourc.es](http://programmingresourc.es) was created as questions such as 'what should I learn from?' are 
common and often poorly answered, with people citing one or two popular resources rather 
than illustrating fully what is available.
