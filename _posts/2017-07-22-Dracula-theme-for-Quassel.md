title:  Dracula theme for the Quassel IRC client

![Theme screenshot window](/img/2017-07-22-screenshot.png)

I use [Quassel](http://www.quassel-irc.org/) as my client for [IRC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat).

I decided to create a new theme/stylesheet for quassel as it's default colours scheme and other [styles](http://bugs.quassel-irc.org/projects/quassel-irc/wiki/Stylesheet_Gallery) didn't fit well with the default Budgie desktop.
I forked the [DarkSolarized](https://gist.github.com/Zren/e91ad5197f9d6b6d410f) theme and applied [Dracula](https://github.com/dracula/dracula-theme) colours.
