title:  Dracula theme for Quassel

---

I use [Quassel](http://www.quassel-irc.org/) as my client for [IRC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat). This morning I decided to make a theme for it using [Dracula's](https://github.com/dracula/dracula-theme) colour palette.

Quassel's default colour scheme and other available [styles](http://bugs.quassel-irc.org/projects/quassel-irc/wiki/Stylesheet_Gallery) didn't fit well with the default Budgie desktop used in [Solus](https://solus-project.com/). I forked the [DarkSolarized](https://gist.github.com/Zren/e91ad5197f9d6b6d410f) theme and applied [Dracula](https://github.com/dracula/dracula-theme) colours.

I have some UI elements hidden to look like this; menu bar (Ctrl + M), main toolbar, status bar, show icons, show nick selector and show style buttons. I am using the 'Fusion' client style but some of the others work well too. The client now fits much better into the overall desktop.

You can grab a copy of my theme [here](https://github.com/dracula/quassel/blob/master/Dracula.qss).
